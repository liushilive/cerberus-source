# Cerberus release processes

[Cerberus](http://www.cerberus-testing.org/) is an user-friendly automated testing framework.

This project is the entry point to release Cerberus project modules.

## Get started

This project defines a set of release processes, each of them represented by a `.cmds` file.

A `.cmds` file gathers all necessary commands to be executed in order to apply a release process. These commands can be executed thanks to the [runcmds](https://github.com/abourdon/runcmds) command execution tool.
 
Finally, each `.cmds` file contains a documentation header part to describe how to use it.

### step by step

Go to your cerberus/source/src/main/webapp folder and modify the file DatabaseMaintenance.jsp. The variable `Integer SQLLimit` must be set to the current version of database + 1 :

 * `cd <path_to_cerberusclone>/source/src/main/webapp`
 * `vim DatabaseMaintenance.jsp (modify the file)`
 * `git commit -m "change database version to <database_version>`
 * `git push origin master`
 
 Where:
  - <database_version> is the current database version

You need to be able to push cerberus on sourceforge
To do that, fill your Maven's settings file with the following information:

    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>default</id>
            <properties>
                <cerberus.sourceforge.username>USERNAME,cerberus-source</cerberus.sourceforge.username>
                <cerberus.sourceforge.password>PASSWORD</cerberus.sourceforge.password>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>

    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>default</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>

Where:
 - USERNAME is your Cerberus' Sourceforge username
 - PASSWORD is your Cerberus' Sourceforge password
    
Note that user Maven's settings file is usually located at ~/.m2/settings.xml

You need to be logged in to docker registry to perform the docker's release
`
    docker login -p <password> -u <username>
`

Where:
 - <password> is your docker hub password
 - <username> is your docker hub username
 
**/!\ you need to have the right on cerberus repository for sourceforge and docker hub**
 
Clone runcmds.sh somewhere on your computer : `git clone https://github.com/abourdon/runcmds`

Go to your cerberus/release folder
`
    cd <path_to_cerberusclone>/release/
`

And run the release cmd :
`
 <path_to_runcmds>/runcmds.sh
       -e RELEASE_VERSION <release version> \
       -e NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION <next development version> \
       -e RUNCMDS_PATH <runcmds command path> \
       -s ./common.cmds
`

`common.cmds` will clone a cerberus on release/cerberus-testing, change some version on bin/*.sh script and make a `mvn release`.
After that, common.cmds will wait new version of cerberus is available on sourceforge, and create new docker version.
