#
#       Where:
#           - USERNAME is your Cerberus' Sourceforge username
#           - PASSWORD is your Cerberus' Sourceforge password
#   5. Have Docker 1.12+ installed
#   6. Be able to push to the [Cerberus Testing's Docker hub space](https://hub.docker.com/r/cerberustesting)
#   7. Be logged to the public Docker hub registry
#   8. Have the [runcmds](https://github.com/abourdon/runcmds) command execution tool installed
#   9. If you have not read it yet, read the runcmds's README file :-)
#
# How to run it
# -------------
#
#   In order to run this command execution flow, use the runcmds tool by executing:
#
#   runcmds.sh
#       -e RELEASE_VERSION <release version> \
#       -e NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION <next development version> \
#       -e RUNCMDS_PATH <runcmds command path> \
#       -s ./common.cmds
#
#   Where:
#       - <release version> is the needed release version
#       - <next development version> is the next needed development version
#       - <runcmds command path> is the path to the runcmds command line (usually <runcmds root>/runcmds.sh)

# Release of the cerberus-source project
rm -rf cerberus-source
git clone https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-source.git
cd cerberus-source
${RUNCMDS_PATH} -e RELEASE_VERSION ${RELEASE_VERSION} -e NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION ${NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION} -s release.cmds

# Waiting for cerberus-source's artifact availability from Sourceforge
while [[ `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://sourceforge.net/projects/cerberus-source/files/Cerberus-${RELEASE_VERSION}.zip/download` != '302' ]]; do echo 'Artifact Cerberus-${RELEASE_VERSION}.zip is not yet ready to be downloaded from Sourceforge. Sleeping 10s and retry.' && sleep 10; done

# Release of the cerberus-as-glassfish project
cd cerberus-source/docker/images/cerberus-as-glassfish
${RUNCMDS_PATH} -e RELEASE_VERSION ${RELEASE_VERSION} -s release.cmds
cd ../../..
rm -rf cerberus-source

# Restore current directory to the initial one
cd ..
