==== Tutorials

*First steps as an administrator*

NOTE: For non-admin users, please go to the next section : "First steps"

You will find below setting steps for an application to test.

* Create a system. More information here <<Invariants>>

NOTE: _Check you are on the system you have just created (dropdown menu at top right)_ image:homepagesystem.png[MenuSystem,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

* Create an environment.  Example : PROD FR (see <<Environment>>) 
* Create an application. Example : Google (see <<Application>>)
* Edit once again your application, you can now set new parameters. In tab environment, create PROD FR environment and fill http://www.google.fr in host section.

Technical settings are now finished. Please refer to the following section to implement a TestCase.

*First steps* 

NOTE: Please verify with your administrator if system and application are already created.

You will find below step to create and execute a TestCase.

* Create a Test. Example : « Search Engine » (see <<Create test>>)
* Access to TestCase list  and create a TestCase (cf <<Create TestCase>>). Mandatory fields : Test /  Application / TestCase ID (Should already be filled with a reference)

NOTE: _Activation criteria tab : Activate for PROD your TestCase. (default setting not active for PROD) For the example, We will run our TestCase on PROD environment_

* Your TestCase is now created, find it in the list using filters. 
* Edit it (cf <<Implement TestCase>>)
* Create your first step « Open Google »
* Add your first action : *[red]#OpenURL#* value =   www.google.com  or *[red]#OpenURLWithBase#* value =  /  (if URL is already defined in application settings)
* You can add a control : *[red]#VerifyTitle#* Title = Google
* Save the script and click on Run button.
* You are now on execution page. Select country / environment
* Fill robot information. Mandatory fields :  IP / port / browser. 

NOTE: _You must first run your selenium server (see <<Selenium>>)_

TIP: To see execution step by step parameter Synchroneous to N.

* Click on the execution button. image:runbuttonexecution.png[BoutonRun,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

*Congratulations, you've just executed your first Cerberus TestCase !*
